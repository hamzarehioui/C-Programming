# C Programming

## Concerned Courses
These codes were written in parallel with taking the following courses either as *homework* or as *practice*:
* **CSC 1401:** Introduction to Computer Programming
* **CSC 2302:** Data Structures

They are fairly simple exercices done with the sole purpose of using theoretical learning for more practical uses.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have `GCC` installed or any compatible C/C++ compiler
2. Run any of the `.c` files with the command, for example, to run `PatientQueue.c`
```
gcc -o PatientQueue PatientQueue.c
``` 

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Keep in mind that this is a **beginner's** first codes, as well as first programming language, so don't expect the codes to be the best implementations possible. 

The implementations were appropriate for the material that was covered in the time that the code was first written, *especially with CSC2302*.
